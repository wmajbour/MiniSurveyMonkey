# MiniSurveyMonkey

As a collaborative effort involving four dedicated contributors, our goal is to develop an advanced Survey Management System that facilitates seamless survey creation, user participation, and result analysis. Each collaborator brings a unique set of skills and expertise to ensure the success of this project.

Our collaborative approach leverages object-oriented principles to model survey components. Each collaborator's expertise contributes to a cohesive system that seamlessly integrates frontend and backend components while delivering visually appealing and insightful survey results.

The team envisions incorporating user authentication, expanding data visualization options, and supporting additional question types. Collaborative efforts will continue to enhance the Survey Management System's capabilities.
